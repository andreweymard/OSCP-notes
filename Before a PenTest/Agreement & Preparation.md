Before starting a penetration test, we need a clear agreement between the testing team and the organization. This agreement/contract consists of everything that has been previously discussed, and helps everyone understand what will happen during the test. The agreement can be divided into three categories, each comprised of several important parts:

#### Legal

1. A `Non-Disclosure Agreement` (`NDA`): This is a legal document that requires the testing team to keep all sensitive information private. It protects both the organization's data and the details of any security weaknesses found during testing.
    
2. `Permission to test`: This is a formal document that gives the testing team legal permission to do their work. Without it, their activities might look like illegal hacking. Usually, this comes as a signed authorization letter.
    
3. `Contact information`: The agreement lists everyone involved in the test and their roles. This includes the main contact person at the organization, the testing team, and emergency contacts. Having clear communication channels helps deal with any issues quickly.
    

#### Scope & Rules

1. `A scoping questionnaire and document`: These explain exactly what will be tested. The questionnaire asks about the organization's systems and goals, while the document lists which networks and applications will be tested and which ones won't be.
    
2. `Rules of engagement` (`ROE`): This document explains how the testing will be done. It covers things like when testing can happen, what methods can be used, and what to do if something goes wrong. For example, it might say whether testers can try to trick employees (social engineering) or if they should avoid testing during busy hours.
    

#### Contract

1. `Timeline`: This part shows when each phase of the test will happen, from start to finish. It includes time for preparing, testing, and writing reports. It also adds extra time for unexpected issues.
    
2. `Responsibilities`: This section outlines who is responsible for what (client & testers) during the test. It includes who will oversee the testing, who needs to be available during critical testing phases, who handles emergencies, and who is responsible for reviewing and acting on the findings.
    
3. `Deliverables`: These are the final products that will be provided to the organization after testing. This typically includes detailed reports of findings, technical documentation, and recommendations for improvements. The agreement should specify the format, level of detail, and timeline for delivering these materials.
    

In short, this agreement is like a roadmap that keeps everyone on track and ensures the test is done properly and legally, while protecting both the company and the testing team for such an activity. Most importantly, it helps achieve the main goal: finding and fixing security problems to better protect the organization.

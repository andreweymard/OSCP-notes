This file does in fact contain customer-related information, which is regulated by the GDPR in the EU and also constitutes Personally Identifiable Information (PII). PII encompasses any data capable of identifying an individual—either alone or in combination with other details—including names, Social Security numbers, addresses, phone numbers, email addresses, birth dates, financial account details, driver’s license numbers, medical records, and biometric data (e.g., fingerprints). Notably, GDPR fines can reach up to €20 million or 4% of annual global revenue, whichever is higher (for instance, British Airways faced a fine of £183 million in 2019), while CCPA penalties range from $2,500 to $7,500 per violation (per record), and HIPAA fines vary from $137 to $2.3 million per incident type. A breach affecting 1 million records could easily result in tens of millions of dollars in fines.

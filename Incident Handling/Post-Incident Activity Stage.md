- What happened and when?
- How did the team perform in dealing with the incident in regard to plans, playbooks, policies, and procedures?
- Did the business provide the necessary information and respond promptly to aid in handling the incident efficiently? What can be improved?
- What actions have been implemented to contain and eradicate the incident?
- What preventive measures should be put in place to prevent similar incidents in the future?
- What tools and resources are needed to detect and analyze similar incidents in the future?

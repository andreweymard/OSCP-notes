The `Detection & Analysis` stage involves all aspects of detecting an incident, such as utilizing sensors, logs, and trained personnel. It also includes information and knowledge sharing, as well as utilizing context-based threat intelligence. Segmentation of the architecture and having a clear understanding of and visibility within the network are also important factors.

It is highly recommended to create levels of detection by logically categorizing our network as follows:

- Detection at the network perimeter (using firewalls, internet-facing network intrusion detection/prevention systems, demilitarized zone, etc.).
- Detection at the internal network level (using local firewalls, host intrusion detection/prevention systems, etc.).
- Detection at the endpoint level (using antivirus systems, endpoint detection & response systems, etc.).
- Detection at the application level (using application logs, service logs, etc.).

## Initial Investigation
- Date/Time when the incident was reported. Additionally, who detected the incident and/or who reported it?
- How was the incident detected?
- What was the incident? Phishing? System unavailability? etc.
- Assemble a list of impacted systems (if relevant).
- Document who has accessed the impacted systems and what actions have been taken. Make a note of whether this is an ongoing incident or if the suspicious activity has been stopped.
- Physical location, operating systems, IP addresses and hostnames, system owner, system's purpose, current state of the system.
- List of IP addresses, if malware is involved, time and date of detection, type of malware, systems impacted, export of malicious files with forensic information on them (such as hashes, copies of the files, etc.).

Overall, the timeline should contain the information described in the following columns:

|`Date`|`Time of the event`|`hostname`|`event description`|`data source`|
|---|---|---|---|---|

## Incident Severity & Extent Questions

When handling a security incident, we should also try to answer the following questions to get an idea of the incident's severity and extent:

- What is the exploitation impact?
- What are the exploitation requirements?
- Can any business-critical systems be affected by the incident?
- Are there any suggested remediation steps?
- How many systems have been impacted?
- Is the exploit being used in the wild?
- Does the exploit have any worm-like capabilities?

## The Investigation

The investigation starts based on the initially gathered (and limited) information that contains what we know about the incident so far. With this initial data, we will begin a 3-step cyclic process that will iterate over and over again as the investigation evolves. This process includes:

- Creation and usage of indicators of compromise (IOCs).
- Identification of new leads and impacted systems.
- Data collection and analysis from the new leads and impacted systems.

### Creation & Usage Of IOCs

An indicator of compromise (IOC) is a `sign that an incident has occurred`. IOCs are documented in a structured manner, which represents the `artifacts` of the compromise. Examples of IOCs can be IP addresses, hash values of files, and file names. In fact, because IOCs are so important to an investigation, special languages such as `OpenIOC` have been developed to document them and share them in a standard manner. Another widely used standard for IOCs is `YARA`. There are a number of free tools that can be utilized, such as Mandiant's `IOC Editor`, to create or edit IOCs. Using these languages, we can describe and use the artifacts that we uncover during an incident investigation. We may even obtain IOCs from third parties if the adversary or the attack is known. For example, CISA publishes the IOCs in a format called `STIX` (`Structured Threat Information eXpression`). STIX is an open-source, machine-readable language and serialization format, primarily in JSON, used to exchange cyber threat intelligence (CTI) in a standardized and consistent way.

As an example, in [this report](https://www.cisa.gov/news-events/alerts/2025/08/06/cisa-releases-malware-analysis-report-associated-microsoft-sharepoint-vulnerabilities), we can check the "Downloadable copy of IOCs associated with this malware" section for the STIX file, which contains the IOCs in JSON format.

As defined by NIST, the incident handling process consists of the following four distinct stages: ![Incident response process flowchart: Preparation, Detection & Analysis, Containment Eradication & Recovery, Post-Incident Activity.](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/148/ir-lifecycle.png)

An `event` is an action occurring in a system or network. Examples of events include:

- A user sending an email.
- A mouse click.
- A firewall allowing a connection request.

An `incident` is an event with a negative consequence. One example of an incident is a system crash. Another example is unauthorized access to sensitive data. Incidents can also occur due to natural disasters, power failures, so on.

Incident handling is a clearly defined set of procedures for managing and responding to security incidents in a computer or network environment.

These are `incident-specific reports` that focus on one particular event or outbreak. For example, the "Confluence Exploit Leads to LockBit Ransomware" style report walks step-by-step through what happened in that one attack: how the adversary gained access, what they did, how they were detected, what the impact was, etc. The aim is to provide a detailed forensic narrative and actionable findings specific to that incident.

There are `global incident-response reports` as well (such as the 2025 Unit 42 report), which aggregate data from hundreds of incidents across a variety of industries, geographies, and threat actors. Their aim is to identify trends, patterns, emerging threats, and to provide statistical insights, and high-level recommendations for defenders.

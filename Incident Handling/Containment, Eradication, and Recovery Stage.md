![Incident response flow titled “Containment, Eradication, and Recovery Stage.” Steps listed: Investigation is complete → Containment Strategy → Evidence gathering (note: Preserve Evidence) → Identify the attacking host → Eradication and Recovery → Bring systems back to normal operation. Side notes under containment: Forensic images, changing passwords, applying firewall rules, applying a system patch.](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/148/ir_stages.png)

In this stage, we take action to prevent the spread of the incident. We divide the actions into short-term containment and long-term containment.

In short-term containment, the actions taken leave a minimal footprint on the systems on which they occur. Some of these actions can include placing a system in a separate/isolated VLAN, pulling the network cable out of the system(s), or modifying the attacker's C2 DNS name to a system under our control or to a non-existing one. The actions here contain the damage and provide time to develop a more concrete remediation strategy. Additionally, since we keep the systems unaltered (as much as possible), we have the opportunity to take forensic images and preserve evidence if this wasn't already done during the investigation (this is also known as the `backup` substage of the containment stage). If a short-term containment action requires shutting down a system, we have to ensure that this is communicated to the business and appropriate permissions are granted.

In long-term containment actions, we focus on persistent actions and changes. These can include changing user passwords, applying firewall rules, inserting a host intrusion detection system, applying a system patch, and shutting down systems. While performing these activities, we should keep the business and the relevant stakeholders updated. Bear in mind that just because a system is now patched does not mean that the incident is over. Eradication, recovery, and post-incident activities are still pending.

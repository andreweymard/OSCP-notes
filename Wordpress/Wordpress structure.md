## CMS

A CMS is made up of two key components:

- A Content Management Application (CMA) - the interface used to add and manage content.
- A Content Delivery Application (CDA) - the backend that takes the input entered into the CMA and assembles the code into a working, visually appealing website.

## Key WordPress Files

The root directory of WordPress contains files that are needed to configure WordPress to function correctly.

- `index.php` is the homepage of WordPress.
- `license.txt` contains useful information such as the version WordPress installed.
- `wp-activate.php` is used for the email activation process when setting up a new WordPress site.
- `wp-admin` folder contains the login page for administrator access and the backend dashboard. Once a user has logged in, they can make changes to the site based on their assigned permissions. The login page can be located at one of the following paths:
    - `/wp-admin/login.php`
    - `/wp-admin/wp-login.php`
    - `/login.php`
    - `/wp-login.php`

This file can also be renamed to make it more challenging to find the login page.

- `xmlrpc.php` is a file representing a feature of WordPress that enables data to be transmitted with HTTP acting as the transport mechanism and XML as the encoding mechanism. This type of communication has been replaced by the WordPress [REST API](https://developer.wordpress.org/rest-api/reference).

#### Key WordPress files

- The `wp-config.php` file contains information required by WordPress to connect to the database, such as the database name, database host, username and password, authentication keys and salts, and the database table prefix. This configuration file can also be used to activate DEBUG mode, which can be useful in troubleshooting.
- The wp-content folder is the main directory where plugins and themes are stored. The subdirectory uploads/ is usually where any files uploaded to the platform are stored. These directories and files should be carefully enumerated as they may lead to contain sensitive data that could lead to remote code execution or exploitation of other vulnerabilities or misconfigurations.
- `wp-includes` contains everything except for the administrative components and the themes that belong to the website. This is the directory where core files are stored, such as certificates, fonts, JavaScript files, and widgets.

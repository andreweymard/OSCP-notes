## Group Scopes

There are three different `group scopes` that can be assigned when creating a new group.

1. Domain Local Group
2. Global Group
3. Universal Group

#### Domain Local Group

Domain local groups can only be used to manage permissions to domain resources in the domain where it was created. Local groups cannot be used in other domains but `CAN` contain users from `OTHER` domains. Local groups can be nested into (contained within) other local groups but `NOT` within global groups.

#### Global Group

Global groups can be used to grant access to resources in `another domain`. A global group can only contain accounts from the domain where it was created. Global groups can be added to both other global groups and local groups.

#### Universal Group

The universal group scope can be used to manage resources distributed across multiple domains and can be given permissions to any object within the same `forest`. They are available to all domains within an organization and can contain users from any domain. Unlike domain local and global groups, universal groups are stored in the Global Catalog (GC), and adding or removing objects from a universal group triggers forest-wide replication. It is recommended that administrators maintain other groups (such as global groups) as members of universal groups because global group membership within universal groups is less likely to change than individual user membership in global groups. Replication is only triggered at the individual domain level when a user is removed from a global group. If individual users and computers (instead of global groups) are maintained within universal groups, it will trigger forest-wide replication each time a change is made. This can create a lot of network overhead and potential for issues. Below is an example of the groups in AD and their scope settings. Please pay attention to some of the critical groups and their scope. ( Enterprise and Schema admins compared to Domain admins, for example.)

#### AD Group Scope Examples

```

Below is an example of privileges inherited through nested group membership. Though `DCorner` is not a direct member of `Helpdesk Level 1`, their membership in `Help Desk` grants them the same privileges that any member of `Helpdesk Level 1` has. In this case, the privilege would allow them to add a member to the `Tier 1 Admins` group (`GenericWrite`). If this group confers any elevated privileges in the domain, it would likely be a key target for a penetration tester. Here, we could add our user to the group and obtain privileges that members of the `Tier 1 Admins` group are granted, such as local administrator access to one or more hosts that could be used to further access.

## Important Group Attributes

Like users, groups have many [attributes](http://www.selfadsi.org/group-attributes.htm). Some of the most [important group attributes](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/ad/group-objects) include:

- `cn`: The `cn` or Common-Name is the name of the group in Active Directory Domain Services.
    
- `member`: Which user, group, and contact objects are members of the group.
    
- `groupType`: An integer that specifies the group type and scope.
    
- `memberOf`: A listing of any groups that contain the group as a member (nested group membership).
    
- `objectSid`: This is the security identifier or SID of the group, which is the unique value used to identify the group as a security principal.

## Built-in AD Groups

AD contains many [default or built-in security groups](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/identity-protection/access-control/active-directory-security-groups), some of which grant their members powerful rights and privileges which can be abused to escalate privileges within a domain and ultimately gain Domain Admin or SYSTEM privileges on a Domain Controller (DC). Membership in many of these groups should be tightly managed as excessive group membership/privileges is a common flaw in many AD networks that attackers look to abuse. Some of the most common built-in groups are listed below.

|Group Name|Description|
|---|---|
|`Account Operators`|Members can create and modify most types of accounts, including those of users, local groups, and global groups, and members can log in locally to domain controllers. They cannot manage the Administrator account, administrative user accounts, or members of the Administrators, Server Operators, Account Operators, Backup Operators, or Print Operators groups.|
|`Administrators`|Members have full and unrestricted access to a computer or an entire domain if they are in this group on a Domain Controller.|
|`Backup Operators`|Members can back up and restore all files on a computer, regardless of the permissions set on the files. Backup Operators can also log on to and shut down the computer. Members can log onto DCs locally and should be considered Domain Admins. They can make shadow copies of the SAM/NTDS database, which, if taken, can be used to extract credentials and other juicy info.|
|`DnsAdmins`|Members have access to network DNS information. The group will only be created if the DNS server role is or was at one time installed on a domain controller in the domain.|
|`Domain Admins`|Members have full access to administer the domain and are members of the local administrator's group on all domain-joined machines.|
|`Domain Computers`|Any computers created in the domain (aside from domain controllers) are added to this group.|
|`Domain Controllers`|Contains all DCs within a domain. New DCs are added to this group automatically.|
|`Domain Guests`|This group includes the domain's built-in Guest account. Members of this group have a domain profile created when signing onto a domain-joined computer as a local guest.|
|`Domain Users`|This group contains all user accounts in a domain. A new user account created in the domain is automatically added to this group.|
|`Enterprise Admins`|Membership in this group provides complete configuration access within the domain. The group only exists in the root domain of an AD forest. Members in this group are granted the ability to make forest-wide changes such as adding a child domain or creating a trust. The Administrator account for the forest root domain is the only member of this group by default.|
|`Event Log Readers`|Members can read event logs on local computers. The group is only created when a host is promoted to a domain controller.|
|`Group Policy Creator Owners`|Members create, edit, or delete Group Policy Objects in the domain.|
|`Hyper-V Administrators`|Members have complete and unrestricted access to all the features in Hyper-V. If there are virtual DCs in the domain, any virtualization admins, such as members of Hyper-V Administrators, should be considered Domain Admins.|
|`IIS_IUSRS`|This is a built-in group used by Internet Information Services (IIS), beginning with IIS 7.0.|
|`Preâ€“Windows 2000 Compatible Access`|This group exists for backward compatibility for computers running Windows NT 4.0 and earlier. Membership in this group is often a leftover legacy configuration. It can lead to flaws where anyone on the network can read information from AD without requiring a valid AD username and password.|
|`Print Operators`|Members can manage, create, share, and delete printers that are connected to domain controllers in the domain along with any printer objects in AD. Members are allowed to log on to DCs locally and may be used to load a malicious printer driver and escalate privileges within the domain.|
|`Protected Users`|Members of this [group](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/identity-protection/access-control/active-directory-security-groups#protected-users) are provided additional protections against credential theft and tactics such as Kerberos abuse.|
|`Read-only Domain Controllers`|Contains all Read-only domain controllers in the domain.|
|`Remote Desktop Users`|This group is used to grant users and groups permission to connect to a host via Remote Desktop (RDP). This group cannot be renamed, deleted, or moved.|
|`Remote Management Users`|This group can be used to grant users remote access to computers via [Windows Remote Management (WinRM)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/winrm/portal)|
|`Schema Admins`|Members can modify the Active Directory schema, which is the way all objects with AD are defined. This group only exists in the root domain of an AD forest. The Administrator account for the forest root domain is the only member of this group by default.|
|`Server Operators`|This group only exists on domain controllers. Members can modify services, access SMB shares, and backup files on domain controllers. By default, this group has no members.|

Below we have provided some output regarding domain admins and server operators.

```

As we can see above, the default state of the `Server Operators` group is to have no members and is a domain local group by default. In contrast, the `Domain Admins` group seen below has several members and service accounts assigned to it. Domain Admins are also Global groups instead of domain local. More on group membership can be found later in this module. Be wary of who, if anyone, you give access to these groups. An attacker could easily gain the keys to the enterprise if they gain access to a user assigned to these groups.

## User Rights Assignment

Depending on their current group membership, and other factors such as privileges that administrators can assign via Group Policy (GPO), users can have various rights assigned to their account. This Microsoft article on [User Rights Assignment](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/threat-protection/security-policy-settings/user-rights-assignment) provides a detailed explanation of each of the user rights that can be set in Windows. Not every right listed here is important to us from a security standpoint as penetration testers or defenders, but some rights granted to an account can lead to unintended consequences such as privilege escalation or access to sensitive files. For example, let's say we can gain write access over a Group Policy Object (GPO) applied to an OU containing one or more users that we control. In this example, we could potentially leverage a tool such as [SharpGPOAbuse](https://github.com/FSecureLABS/SharpGPOAbuse) to assign targeted rights to a user. We may perform many actions in the domain to further our access with these new rights. A few examples include:

|**Privilege**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|`SeRemoteInteractiveLogonRight`|This privilege could give our target user the right to log onto a host via Remote Desktop (RDP), which could potentially be used to obtain sensitive data or escalate privileges.|
|`SeBackupPrivilege`|This grants a user the ability to create system backups and could be used to obtain copies of sensitive system files that can be used to retrieve passwords such as the SAM and SYSTEM Registry hives and the NTDS.dit Active Directory database file.|
|`SeDebugPrivilege`|This allows a user to debug and adjust the memory of a process. With this privilege, attackers could utilize a tool such as [Mimikatz](https://github.com/ParrotSec/mimikatz) to read the memory space of the Local System Authority (LSASS) process and obtain any credentials stored in memory.|
|`SeImpersonatePrivilege`|This privilege allows us to impersonate a token of a privileged account such as `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`. This could be leveraged with a tool such as JuicyPotato, RogueWinRM, PrintSpoofer, etc., to escalate privileges on a target system.|
|`SeLoadDriverPrivilege`|A user with this privilege can load and unload device drivers that could potentially be used to escalate privileges or compromise a system.|
|`SeTakeOwnershipPrivilege`|This allows a process to take ownership of an object. At its most basic level, we could use this privilege to gain access to a file share or a file on a share that was otherwise not accessible to us.|

There are many techniques available to abuse user rights detailed [here](https://blog.palantir.com/windows-privilege-abuse-auditing-detection-and-defense-3078a403d74e) and [here](https://book.hacktricks.wiki/en/windows-hardening/windows-local-privilege-escalation/privilege-escalation-abusing-tokens.html). Though outside the scope of this module, it is essential to understand the impact that assigning the wrong privilege to an account can have within Active Directory. A small admin mistake can lead to a complete system or enterprise compromise.

## Viewing a User's Privileges

After logging into a host, typing the command `whoami /priv` will give us a listing of all user rights assigned to the current user. Some rights are only available to administrative users and can only be listed/leveraged when running an elevated CMD or PowerShell session. These concepts of elevated rights and [User Account Control (UAC)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/identity-protection/user-account-control/how-user-account-control-works) are security features introduced with Windows Vista that default to restricting applications from running with full permissions unless absolutely necessary. If we compare and contrast the rights available to us as an admin in a non-elevated console vs. an elevated console, we will see that they differ drastically. First, let's look at the rights available to a standard Active Directory user.

#### Standard Domain User's Rights

Active Directory Rights and Privileges

```powershell-session
PS C:\htb> whoami /priv

PRIVILEGES INFORMATION
----------------------

Privilege Name                Description                    State
============================= ============================== ========
SeChangeNotifyPrivilege       Bypass traverse checking       Enabled
SeIncreaseWorkingSetPrivilege Increase a process working set Disabled
```

We can see that the rights are very `limited`, and none of the "dangerous" rights outlined above are present. Next, let's take a look at a privileged user. Below are the rights available to a Domain Admin user.

#### Domain Admin Rights Non-Elevated

We can see the following in a `non-elevated` console which does not appear to be anything more than available to the standard domain user. This is because, by default, Windows systems do not enable all rights to us unless we run the CMD or PowerShell console in an elevated context. This is to prevent every application from running with the highest possible privileges. This is controlled by something called [User Account Control (UAC)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/security/identity-protection/user-account-control/how-user-account-control-works) which is covered in-depth in the [Windows Privilege Escalation](https://academy.hackthebox.com/course/preview/windows-privilege-escalation) module.

User rights increase based on the groups they are placed in or their assigned privileges. Below is an example of the rights granted to a `Backup Operators` group member. Users in this group have other rights currently restricted by UAC (additional rights such as the powerful `SeBackupPrivilege` are not enabled by default in a standard console session). Still, we can see from this command that they have the `SeShutdownPrivilege`, which means they can shut down a domain controller. This privilege on its own could not be used to gain access to sensitive data but could cause a massive service interruption should they log onto a domain controller locally (not remotely via RDP or WinRM).

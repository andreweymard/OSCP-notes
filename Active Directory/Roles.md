| `Schema Master`            | This role manages the read/write copy of the AD schema, which defines all attributes that can apply to an object in AD.                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| `Domain Naming Master`     | Manages domain names and ensures that two domains of the same name are not created in the same forest.                                                                                                                                                                                                             |
| `Relative ID (RID) Master` | The RID Master assigns blocks of RIDs to other DCs within the domain that can be used for new objects. The RID Master helps ensure that multiple objects are not assigned the same SID. Domain object SIDs are the domain SID combined with the RID number assigned to the object to make the unique SID.          |
| `PDC Emulator`             | The host with this role would be the authoritative DC in the domain and respond to authentication requests, password changes, and manage Group Policy Objects (GPOs). The PDC Emulator also maintains time within the domain.                                                                                      |
| `Infrastructure Master`    | This role translates GUIDs, SIDs, and DNs between domains. This role is used in organizations with multiple domains in a single forest. The Infrastructure Master helps them to communicate. If this role is not functioning properly, Access Control Lists (ACLs) will show SIDs instead of fully resolved names. |

In an FTP connection, two channels are opened. First, the client and server establish a control channel through `TCP port 21`. The client sends commands to the server, and the server returns status codes. Then both communication participants can establish the data channel via `TCP port 20`. This channel is used exclusively for data transmission, and the protocol watches for errors during this process.

A distinction is made between active and passive FTP. In the active variant, the client establishes the connection as described via TCP port 21 and thus informs the server via which client-side port the server can transmit its responses. However, if a firewall protects the client, the server cannot reply because all external connections are blocked. For this purpose, the passive mode has been developed. Here, the server announces a port through which the client can establish the data channel. Since the client initiates the connection in this method, the firewall does not block the transfer.

## TFTP

`Trivial File Transfer Protocol` (`TFTP`) is simpler than FTP and performs file transfers between client and server processes. However, it `does not` provide user authentication and other valuable features supported by FTP.

Let us take a look at a few commands of `TFTP`:

| **Commands** | **Description**                                                                                                                        |
| ------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `connect`    | Sets the remote host, and optionally the port, for file transfers.                                                                     |
| `get`        | Transfers a file or set of files from the remote host to the local host.                                                               |
| `put`        | Transfers a file or set of files from the local host onto the remote host.                                                             |
| `quit`       | Exits tftp.                                                                                                                            |
| `status`     | Shows the current status of tftp, including the current transfer mode (ascii or binary), connection status, time-out value, and so on. |
| `verbose`    | Turns verbose mode, which displays additional information during file transfer, on or off.                                             |

Unlike the FTP client, `TFTP` does not have directory listing functionality.

#### vsFTPd Config File

|**Setting**|**Description**|
|---|---|
|`listen=NO`|Run from inetd or as a standalone daemon?|
|`listen_ipv6=YES`|Listen on IPv6 ?|
|`anonymous_enable=NO`|Enable Anonymous access?|
|`local_enable=YES`|Allow local users to login?|
|`dirmessage_enable=YES`|Display active directory messages when users go into certain directories?|
|`use_localtime=YES`|Use local time?|
|`xferlog_enable=YES`|Activate logging of uploads/downloads?|
|`connect_from_port_20=YES`|Connect from port 20?|
|`secure_chroot_dir=/var/run/vsftpd/empty`|Name of an empty directory|
|`pam_service_name=vsftpd`|This string is the name of the PAM service vsftpd will use.|
|`rsa_cert_file=/etc/ssl/certs/ssl-cert-snakeoil.pem`|The last three options specify the location of the RSA certificate to use for SSL encrypted connections.|
|`rsa_private_key_file=/etc/ssl/private/ssl-cert-snakeoil.key`||
|`ssl_enable=NO`||

In addition, there is a file called `/etc/ftpusers` that we also need to pay attention to, as this file is used to deny certain users access to the FTP service. In the following example, the users `guest`, `john`, and `kevin` are not permitted to log in to the FTP service, even if they exist on the Linux system.

## Dangerous Settings

There are many different security-related settings we can make on each FTP server. These can have various purposes, such as testing connections through the firewalls, testing routes, and authentication mechanisms. One of these authentication mechanisms is the `anonymous` user. This is often used to allow everyone on the internal network to share files and data without accessing each other's computers. With vsFTPd, the [optional settings](http://vsftpd.beasts.org/vsftpd_conf.html) that can be added to the configuration file for the anonymous login look like this:

| **Setting**                    | **Description**                                                                    |

- **What it is:** A Security Operations Center (SOC) is a dedicated facility with a team of information security experts.
- **Primary Mission:** To continuously monitor, evaluate, and defend an organization's security status.
- **Core Objective:** To identify, analyze, and respond to cybersecurity incidents.
- **Who is on the team:** The team consists of security analysts, engineers, and managers who work closely with incident response teams.
- **Key Technologies Used:** The SOC uses a mix of tools, including SIEM (Security Information and Event Management), IDS/IPS (Intrusion Detection/Prevention Systems), and EDR (Endpoint Detection and Response).
- **Proactive Methods:** The team uses threat intelligence and engages in threat hunting to find potential threats before they become incidents.
- **Key Processes:** The SOC follows a defined procedure for handling incidents, which includes triage, containment, elimination, and recovery.
- **Overall Value:** A SOC is a vital part of a cybersecurity strategy that enables organizations to quickly detect and resolve security incidents, minimizing the impact of a breach and reducing the likelihood of future attacks.

### How Does A SOC Work?
- **Focus on Operations:** The SOC's main job is managing the ongoing, operational side of security, not designing strategy or architecture.
- **Team Composition:** The team is primarily made up of security analysts
- **Core Functions:** Their work is to detect, assess, respond to, report on, and prevent cybersecurity incidents.
- **Advanced Capabilities (in some SOCs):** Some SOCs perform forensic analysis and malware analysis to conduct deep investigations.
- **Goal of Advanced Analysis**: This in-depth analysis helps find the root cause of an incident to prevent future attacks.
- **Collaboration**: The SOC team works closely with the incident response (IR) team to ensure security incidents are handled properly.

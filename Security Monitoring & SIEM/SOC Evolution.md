### SOC 1.0
- **Focus:** Primarily on **network and perimeter security**, evolving from earlier Network Operation Centers (NOCs).
- **Tools:** Organizations invested in separate, individual security layers (like identity management or intelligence platforms).
- **Key Failure:** A **lack of proper integration** between these tools led to uncorrelated alerts and a backlog of tasks.
### SOC 2.0
- **Driver:** Developed in response to **sophisticated, persistent, and multi-vector threats** (e.g., botnets, advanced malware).
- **Foundation:** Built on **intelligence**. It **integrates** security telemetry, threat intelligence, network flow analysis, and anomaly detection.
- **Methods:** Uses **Layer-7 analysis** to find "low and slow" hidden attacks and emphasizes collaboration between SOCs.
- **Complete Focus:** Stresses **pre-event preparedness** (vulnerability management), **situational awareness**, and **post-event analysis** (incident response, forensics).
### Cognitive SOC (Next-Gen)
- **Purpose:** Aims to fix the shortcomings of SOC 2.0, which often lacks operational experience and collaboration between security and business teams.
- **Key Feature:** It incorporates **learning systems (AI)**.
- **Goal:** To **compensate for experience gaps** in security decision-making and improve threat detection specific to business processes.

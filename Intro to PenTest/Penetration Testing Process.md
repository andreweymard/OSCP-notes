- `Pre-Engagement`: In this phase, everything necessary for the actual penetration test is discussed, developed, defined, and documented in writing. Here we obtain the necessary permissions and rights to execute hacking attacks on predetermined systems and simulate a real cyber attack.
    
- `Information Gathering`: In this phase, we collect as much information as possible about the target company to understand exactly how it is structured, how it functions, what it depends on, and what technical resources it requires.
    
- `Vulnerability Assessment`: After collecting as much information as possible, this must be carefully analyzed and correlated to identify potential attack vectors that could lead to a successful attack.
    
- `Exploitation`: Here, the identified attack vectors are targeted and defense mechanisms are bypassed.
    
- `Post-Exploitation`: Once we have gained access to a target system to control it from the inside and gathered enough internal information, we attempt to escalate privileges to the highest possible level.
    
- `Lateral Movement`: This phase occurs when we use the compromised system to move through the internal network.
    
- `Proof-of-Concept`: From all our notes, screenshots, and documentation, a report is created with the individual steps to reproduce our actions for successfully identifying each vulnerability.
    
- `Post-Engagement`: This is the phase where we show the report to the client and discuss it together, answer questions, and help them close the vulnerabilities found.
    

![Flowchart of the Penetration Testing Process: Pre-Engagement leads to Information Gathering, then to Vulnerability Assessment. This connects to Exploitation, Lateral Movement, and Post-Exploitation. All lead to Proof-of-Concept, ending with Post-Engagement.](https://academy.hackthebox.com/storage/modules/296/0-PT-Process.jpg)

Most professional pentesters `don't strictly adhere` to a single methodology but rather combine elements from various frameworks together. This hybrid approach allows for flexibility while maintaining structure and thoroughness.

#### Developing Your Personal Methodology

While established frameworks provide `excellent foundations`, experienced penetration testers often develop their own customized methodologies, incorporating their unique experiences and lessons learned from previous engagements. Each penetration test presents different challenges and scenarios, and documenting these experiences helps build a more robust and practical methodology. Additionally, a personal methodology can be tailored to specific types of assessments or industries that a pentester frequently encounters . For example, a tester specializing in healthcare systems might develop unique procedures for handling sensitive medical data, or for complying with HIPAA requirements.

#### Steps to Develop Your Methodology

- Start with established frameworks as a foundation
    
- Learn and practice to take notes properly for yourself
    
- Practice and improve your problem solving approach
    
- Document successful techniques and approaches from each box, lab, and engagement
    
- Incorporate tools and scripts that have proven effective, rewrite them, and write your own
    
- Create custom checklists for different testing cases (web app testing, network testing, information gathering, etc.)
    
- Regularly update your methodology based on the experience you gain
    

A `personal methodology` should be flexible enough to adapt to different scenarios while maintaining the rigor and systematic approach necessary for professional penetration testing. It should also include clear documentation practices, helping to maintain consistency across engagements and facilitate knowledge sharing with team members.

Remember that methodology development is an iterative process. As you gain experience and encounter new challenges, your approach should evolve to incorporate new techniques, tools, and best practices. This continuous improvement ensures your methodology remains effective and relevant in the ever-changing landscape of cybersecurity.

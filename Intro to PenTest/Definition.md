VA is part of a PT not the other way.

Penetration testing encompasses a wide range of tasks, including:

- Reconnaissance
- Vulnerability Assessment
- Exploitation
- Post-exploitation
- Reporting

In a highly simplified illustration, we could imagine a penetration test proceeding in the following manner:

1. It starts with `reconnaissance` (also known as `information gathering`), where testers gather information about the target organization, system or network, like scouting out a building before planning a break-in.
    
2. Next, in the `vulnerability assessment` phase, they use tools to spot weak points, similar to checking for unlocked windows or doors.
    
3. During the `exploitation` phase, testers try to exploit those weaknesses to gain access or control over the system, just as a thief might test those unlocked doors.
    
4. After that, in the `post-exploitation` phase, they explore what else can be accessed, maintain control, and assess the impact of a successful attack, like seeing how far an intruder could roam inside a building.
    
5. Finally, the `reporting` phase documents everything: the vulnerabilities found, the risks they pose, and clear steps to fix them, so the system can be secured.

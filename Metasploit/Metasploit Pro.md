`Metasploit` as a product is split into two versions. The `Metasploit Pro` version is different from the `Metasploit Framework` one with some additional features:

- Task Chains
- Social Engineering
- Vulnerability Validations
- GUI
- Quick Start Wizards
- Nexpose Integration

If you're more of a command-line user and prefer the extra features, the Pro version also contains its own console, much like `msfconsole`.

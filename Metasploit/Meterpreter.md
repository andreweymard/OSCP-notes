The `Meterpreter` Payload is a specific type of multi-faceted, extensible Payload that uses `DLL injection` to ensure the connection to the victim host is stable and difficult to detect using simple checks and can be configured to be persistent across reboots or system changes. Furthermore, Meterpreter resides entirely in the memory of the remote host and leaves no traces on the hard drive, making it difficult to detect with conventional forensic techniques.

It is dubbed the swiss army knife of pentesting, and for a good reason. The purpose of Meterpreter is to specifically improve our post-exploitation procedures, offering us a hand-picked set of relevant tools for more straightforward enumeration of the target host from the inside. It can help us find various privilege escalation techniques, AV evasion techniques, further vulnerability research, provide persistent access, pivot, etc.

These topics are outside the scope of this module, but we should be aware of these possibilities.

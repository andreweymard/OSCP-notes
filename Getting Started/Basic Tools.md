## Resources
When starting, the sheer amount of content available on the web can be overwhelming. Furthermore, it isn't easy to know where to start and the quality of materials available. What follows are some resources outside of HTB that we recommend to anyone starting on their journey or looking to enhance their skillset and pick up new tricks.
#### Vulnerable Machines/Applications
There are many resources available to practice common web and network vulnerabilities in a safe, controlled setting. The following are some examples of purposefully vulnerable web applications and vulnerable machines that we can set up in a lab environment for extra practice.

|Title| Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
|---|---|
|[OWASP Juice Shop](https://owasp.org/www-project-juice-shop/)| Is a modern vulnerable web application written in Node.js, Express, and Angular which showcases the entire [OWASP Top Ten](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten) along with many other real-world application security flaws. |
|[Metasploitable 2](https://docs.rapid7.com/metasploit/metasploitable-2-exploitability-guide/)| Is a purposefully vulnerable Ubuntu Linux VM that can be used to practice enumeration, automated, and manual exploitation.                                                                                                     |
|[Metasploitable 3](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploitable3)| Is a template for building a vulnerable Windows VM configured with a wide range of [vulnerabilities](https://github.com/rapid7/metasploitable3/wiki/Vulnerabilities).                                                          |
|[DVWA](https://github.com/digininja/DVWA)| This is a vulnerable PHP/MySQL web application showcasing many common web application vulnerabilities with varying degrees of difficulty.                                                                                      |
It is worth learning how to set these up in your lab environment to gain extra practice setting up VMs and working with common configurations such as setting up a web server. Aside from these vulnerable machines/applications, we can also set up many machines and applications in a lab environment to practice configuration, enumeration/exploitation, and remediation.
#### YouTube Channels

There are many YouTube channels out there that showcase penetration testing/hacking techniques. A few worth bookmarking are:

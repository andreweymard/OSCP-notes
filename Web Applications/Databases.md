There are 4 common storage models for `NoSQL` databases:

- Document-Based
- Wide-Column

A [non-relational database](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NoSQL) does not use tables, rows, columns, primary keys, relationships, or schemas. Instead, a `NoSQL` database stores data using various storage models, depending on the type of data stored.

Some of the most common `NoSQL` databases include.

|---|---|
|[MongoDB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MongoDB)|The most common `NoSQL` database. It is free and open-source, uses the `Document-Based` model, and stores data in `JSON` objects|
|[ElasticSearch](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elasticsearch)|Another free and open-source `NoSQL` database. It is optimized for storing and analyzing huge datasets. As its name suggests, searching for data within this database is very fast and efficient|
|[Apache Cassandra](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apache_Cassandra)|Also free and open-source. It is very scalable and is optimized for gracefully handling faulty values|

Other common `NoSQL` databases include: `Redis`, `Neo4j`, `CouchDB`, and `Amazon DynamoDB`.

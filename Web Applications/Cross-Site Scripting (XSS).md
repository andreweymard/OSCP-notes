There are three main types of `XSS`:

|Type|Description|
|---|---|
|`Reflected XSS`|Occurs when user input is displayed on the page after processing (e.g., search result or error message).|
|`Stored XSS`|Occurs when user input is stored in the back end database and then displayed upon retrieval (e.g., posts or comments).|
|`DOM XSS`|Occurs when user input is directly shown in the browser and is written to an `HTML` DOM object (e.g., vulnerable username or page title).|

web application attacks and the impact are as follows:

|Flaw|Real-world Scenario|
|---|---|
|[SQL injection](https://owasp.org/www-community/attacks/SQL_Injection)|Obtaining Active Directory usernames and performing a password spraying attack against a VPN or email portal.|
|[File Inclusion](https://owasp.org/www-project-web-security-testing-guide/v42/4-Web_Application_Security_Testing/07-Input_Validation_Testing/11.1-Testing_for_Local_File_Inclusion)|Reading source code to find a hidden page or directory which exposes additional functionality that can be used to gain remote code execution.|
|[Unrestricted File Upload](https://owasp.org/www-community/vulnerabilities/Unrestricted_File_Upload)|A web application that allows a user to upload a profile picture that allows any file type to be uploaded (not just images). This can be leveraged to gain full control of the web application server by uploading malicious code.|
|[Insecure Direct Object Referencing (IDOR)](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Insecure_Direct_Object_Reference_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html)|When combined with a flaw such as broken access control, this can often be used to access another user's files or functionality. An example would be editing your user profile browsing to a page such as /user/701/edit-profile. If we can change the `701` to `702`, we may edit another user's profile!|
|[Broken Access Control](https://owasp.org/www-project-top-ten/2017/A5_2017-Broken_Access_Control)|Another example is an application that allows a user to register a new account. If the account registration functionality is designed poorly, a user may perform privilege escalation when registering. Consider the `POST` request when registering a new user, which submits the data `username=bjones&password=Welcome1&email=bjones@inlanefreight.local&roleid=3`. What if we can manipulate the `roleid` parameter and change it to `0` or `1`. We have seen real-world applications where this was the case, and it was possible to quickly register an admin user and access many unintended features of the web application.|

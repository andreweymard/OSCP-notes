We should make a clear distinction between these two stages: `Exploitation` & `Post-Exploitation`. As the names of these two suggest, both stages are about the exploitation. However, if you search for “penetration testing process” you will see many sources on the internet that will tell you that `Post-Exploitation` comes right after `Exploitation`. This is true, but not necessarily all the time.

The `Post-Exploitation` stage aims to obtain sensitive and security-relevant information from a local perspective that, in most cases, requires higher privileges than a standard user. This stage includes the following components:

|                      |                          |
| -------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Evasive Testing      | Information Gathering    |
| Pillaging            | Vulnerability Assessment |
| Privilege Escalation | Persistence              |
| Data Exfiltration    |                          |
The main difference between the two is the level of access we have. In the `Exploitation` stage, we usually do not have any local or privileged access to any of the provided services of the target. However, in the `Post-Exploitation` stage we do. In other words, `Exploitation` stage is when we attack the target system from outside and `Post-Exploitation` when we attack it from within.

The transition from `Exploitation` to `Post-Exploitation` also occurs if we're obtain the highest possible privileges, after exploiting an exposed service from the outside the target system. Once we have these privileges, we can start to collect and extract valuable information from the target.

* This is Microsoft's application whitelisting solution.
* This gives system administrators control over which applications and files users can run. It gives granular control over executables, scripts, Windows installer files, DLLs, packaged apps, and packed app installers.
* Allows for creating rules based on file attributes such as the publisher's name (which can be derived from the digital signature), product name, file name, and version.
* Rules can also be set up based on file paths and hashes.
* Rules can be applied to either security groups or individual users, based on the business need.
* AppLocker can be deployed in audit mode first to test the impact before enforcing all of the rules.

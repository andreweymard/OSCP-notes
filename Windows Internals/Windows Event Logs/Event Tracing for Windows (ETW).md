## What is ETW?

According to Microsoft, `Event Tracing For Windows (ETW)` is a general-purpose, high-speed tracing facility provided by the operating system. Using a buffering and logging mechanism implemented in the kernel, ETW provides a tracing mechanism for events raised by both user-mode applications and kernel-mode device drivers.

## ETW Architecture & Components

The underlying architecture and the key components of Event Tracing for Windows (ETW) are illustrated in the following diagram from [Microsoft](https://web.archive.org/web/20200725154736/https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/archive/blogs/ntdebugging/part-1-etw-introduction-and-overview).

- `Controllers`: The Controllers component, as its name implies, assumes control over all aspects related to ETW operations. It encompasses functionalities such as initiating and terminating trace sessions, as well as enabling or disabling providers within a particular trace. Trace sessions can establish subscriptions to one or multiple providers, thereby granting the providers the ability to commence logging operations. An example of a widely used controller is the built-in utility "logman.exe," which facilitates the management of ETW activities.

At the core of ETW's architecture is the publish-subscribe model. This model involves two primary components:

- `Providers`: Providers play a pivotal role in generating events and writing them to the designated ETW sessions. Applications have the ability to register ETW providers, enabling them to generate and transmit numerous events. There are four distinct types of providers utilized within ETW.
    - `MOF Providers`: These providers are based on Managed Object Format (MOF) and are capable of generating events according to predefined MOF schemas. They offer a flexible approach to event generation and are widely used in various scenarios.
    - `WPP Providers`: Standing for "Windows Software Trace Preprocessor," WPP providers leverage specialized macros and annotations within the application's source code to generate events. This type of provider is often utilized for low-level kernel-mode tracing and debugging purposes.
    - `Manifest-based Providers`: Manifest-based providers represent a more contemporary form of providers within ETW. They rely on XML manifest files that define the structure and characteristics of events. This approach offers enhanced flexibility and ease of management, allowing for dynamic event generation and customization.
    - `TraceLogging Providers`: TraceLogging providers offer a simplified and efficient approach to event generation. They leverage the TraceLogging API, introduced in recent Windows versions, which streamlines the process of event generation with minimal code overhead.
- `Consumers`: Consumers subscribe to specific events of interest and receive those events for further processing or analysis. By default, the events are typically directed to an .ETL (Event Trace Log) file for handling. However, an alternative consumer scenario involves leveraging the capabilities of the Windows API to process and consume the events.
- `Channels`: To facilitate efficient event collection and consumption, ETW relies on event channels. Event channels act as logical containers for organizing and filtering events based on their characteristics and importance. ETW supports multiple channels, each with its own defined purpose and audience. Event consumers can selectively subscribe to specific channels to receive relevant events for their respective use cases.
- `ETL files`: ETW provides specialized support for writing events to disk through the use of event trace log files, commonly referred to as "ETL files." These files serve as durable storage for events, enabling offline analysis, long-term archiving, and forensic investigations. ETW allows for seamless rotation and management of ETL files to ensure efficient storage utilization.

**Notes**:

- ETW supports event providers in both kernel mode and user mode.
- Some event providers generate a significant volume of events, which can potentially overwhelm the system resources if they are constantly active. As a result, to prevent unnecessary resource consumption, these providers are typically disabled by default and are only enabled when a tracing session specifically requests their activation.
- In addition to its inherent capabilities, ETW can be extended through custom event providers.
- [Only ETW provider events that have a Channel property applied to them can be consumed by the event log](https://medium.com/threat-hunters-forge/threat-hunting-with-etw-events-and-helk-part-1-installing-silketw-6eb74815e4a0)


```cmd-session
C:\Tools> logman.exe query -ets
C:\Tools> logman.exe query "EventLog-System" -ets
C:\Tools> logman.exe query providers
C:\Tools> logman.exe query providers | findstr "Winlogon"
C:\Tools> logman.exe query providers Microsoft-Windows-Winlogon
```
Employing the -ets parameter will allow for a direct investigation of the event tracing sessions, providing insights into system-wide tracing sessions.

For each provider subscribed to the session, we can acquire critical data:

- `Name / Provider GUID`: This is the exclusive identifier for the provider.
- `Level`: This describes the event level, indicating if it's filtering for warning, informational, critical, or all events.
- `Keywords Any`: Keywords create a filter based on the kind of event generated by the provider.

The `Microsoft-Windows-Winlogon/Diagnostic` and `Microsoft-Windows-Winlogon/Operational` keywords reference the event logs generated from this provider.

## Useful Providers

- `Microsoft-Windows-Kernel-Process`: This ETW provider is instrumental in monitoring process-related activity within the Windows kernel. It can aid in detecting unusual process behaviors such as process injection, process hollowing, and other tactics commonly used by malware and advanced persistent threats (APTs).

## Restricted Providers

In the realm of Windows operating system security, certain ETW providers are considered "restricted." These providers offer valuable telemetry but are only accessible to processes that carry the requisite permissions. This exclusivity is designed to ensure that sensitive system data remains shielded from potential threats.

One of these high-value, restricted providers is `Microsoft-Windows-Threat-Intelligence`. This provider offers crucial insights into potential security threats and is often leveraged in Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR) operations. However, to access this provider, processes must be privileged with a specific right, known as Protected Process Light (PPL).

According to Elastic:_To be able to run as a PPL, an anti-malware vendor must apply to Microsoft, prove their identity, sign binding legal documents, implement an Early Launch Anti-Malware (ELAM) driver, run it through a test suite, and submit it to Microsoft for a special Authenticode signature. It is not a trivial process. Once this process is complete, the vendor can use this ELAM driver to have Windows protect their anti-malware service by running it as a PPL._ With that said, [workarounds to access the `Microsoft-Windows-Threat-Intelligence` provider exist](https://posts.specterops.io/uncovering-windows-events-b4b9db7eac54).

In the context of `Microsoft-Windows-Threat-Intelligence`, the benefits of this privileged access are manifold. This provider can record highly granular data about potential threats, enabling security professionals to detect and analyze sophisticated attacks that may have eluded other defenses. Its telemetry can serve as vital evidence in forensic investigations, revealing details about the origin of a threat, the systems and data it interacted with, and the alterations it made. Moreover, by monitoring this provider in real-time, security teams can potentially identify ongoing threats and intervene to mitigate damage.

In the next section, we will utilize ETW to investigate attacks that may evade detection if we rely solely on Sysmon for monitoring and analysis, due to its inherent limitations in capturing certain events.

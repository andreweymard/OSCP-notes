`Windows Event Logs` are an intrinsic part of the Windows Operating System, storing logs from different components of the system including the system itself, applications running on it, ETW providers, services, and others.

The logs are categorized into different event logs, such as "Application", "System", "Security", and others, to organize events based on their source or purpose.

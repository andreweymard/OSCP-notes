#### Types of NAT

It's important to know that there are several types of Network Address Translation (NAT), each designed for specific networking needs. Below are the different types of NAT. RFC 1918

| **Type**                         | **Description**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |

| `Static NAT`                     | Involves a one-to-one mapping, where each private IP address corresponds directly to a public IP address.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| `Dynamic NAT`                    | Assigns a public IP from a pool of available addresses to a private IP as needed, based on network demand.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| `Port Address Translation (PAT)` | Also known as NAT Overload, is the most common form of NAT in home networks. Multiple private IP addresses share a single public IP address, differentiating connections by using unique port numbers. This method is widely used in home and small office networks, allowing multiple devices to share a single public IP address for internet access. |

#### DNS Hierarchy

DNS is organized like a tree, starting from the root and branching out into different layers.

| **Layer**                  | **Description**                                                                   |
| -------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Root Servers`             | The top of the DNS hierarchy.                                                     |
| `Top-Level Domains (TLDs)` | Such as `.com`, `.org`, `.net`, or country codes like `.uk`, `.de`.               |
| `Second-Level Domains`     | For example, `example` in `example.com`.                                          |
| `Subdomains or Hostname`   | For instance, `www` in `www.example.com`, or `accounts` in `accounts.google.com`. |

#### DNS Resolution Process (Domain Translation)

When we enter a domain name in our browser, the computer needs to find the corresponding IP address. This process is known as `DNS resolution` or `domain translation`. The steps below show how this process works.

| **Step** | **Description**                                                                                                                                                  |
| -------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `Step 1` | We type `www.example.com` into our browser.                                                                                                                      |
| `Step 2` | Our computer checks its local   (a small storage area) to see if it already knows the IP address.                                                                |
| `Step 3` | If not found locally, it queries a `recursive DNS server`. This is often provided by our Internet Service Provider or a third-party DNS service like Google DNS. |
| `Step 4` | The recursive DNS server contacts a `root server`, which points it to the appropriate `TLD name server` (such as the `.com` domains, for instance).              |
| `Step 5` | The TLD name server directs the query to the `authoritative name server` for `example.com`.                                                                      |
| `Step 6` | The authoritative name server responds with the IP address for `www.example.com`.                                                                                |
| `Step 7` | The recursive server returns this IP address to your computer, which can then connect to the websiteâ€™s server directly.                                          |

This all happens in just fractions of a second. Below we can see a simple example of the Domain Translation process. Suppose you want to visit the website at `www.example.com`. Without the Domain Name System (DNS), we would need to know and type the IP address, such as `93.184.216.34`, every time you want to access that site. With DNS in place, we can simply type `www.example.com` into our browser. Behind the scenes, DNS automatically finds and translates this domain name into the correct IP address for us, ensuring a seamless connection to the website. The diagram below illustrates the diagram of the `DNS Query Process`.

| `HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol)`   | Primarily used for transferring web pages. It operates at the Application Layer, allowing browsers and servers to communicate in the delivery of web content.                                                                    |
| `FTP (File Transfer Protocol)`         | Facilitates the transfer of files between systems, also functioning at the Application Layer. It provides a way for users to upload or download files to and from servers.                                                       |
| `SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol)` | Handles the transmission of email. Operating at the Application Layer, it is responsible for sending messages from one server to another, ensuring they reach their intended recipients.                                         |
| `TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)`  | Ensures reliable data transmission through error checking and recovery, operating at the Transport Layer. It establishes a connection between sender and receiver to guarantee the delivery of data in the correct order.        |
| `UDP (User Datagram Protocol)`         | Allows for fast, connectionless communication, which operates without error recovery. This makes it ideal for applications that require speed over reliability, such as streaming services. UDP operates at the Transport Layer. |
| `IP (Internet Protocol)`               | Crucial for routing packets across network boundaries, functioning at the Internet Layer. It handles the addressing and routing of packets to ensure they travel from the source to the destination across diverse networks.     |
| QUIC (Quick UDP Internet Connections)  | It was designed by Google as a modern alternative to TCP. While it operates at the same layer as TCP and UDP, QUIC is unique because it is built **on top of UDP**.                                                              |

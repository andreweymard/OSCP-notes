## CIDR

`Classless Inter-Domain Routing` (`CIDR`) is a method of representation and replaces the fixed assignment between IPv4 address and network classes (A, B, C, D, E). The division is based on the subnet mask or the so-called `CIDR suffix`, which allows the bitwise division of the IPv4 address space and thus into `subnets` of any size. The `CIDR suffix` indicates how many bits from the beginning of the IPv4 address belong to the network. It is a notation that represents the `subnet mask` by specifying the number of `1`-bits in the subnet mask.

Let us stick to the following IPv4 address and subnet mask as an example:

- IPv4 Address: `192.168.10.39`
    
- Subnet mask: `255.255.255.0`
    

Now the whole representation of the IPv4 address and the subnet mask would look like this:

- CIDR: `192.168.10.39/24`

The CIDR suffix is, therefore, the sum of all ones in the subnet mask.
